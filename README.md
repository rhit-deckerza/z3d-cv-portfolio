# z3d-cv-portfolio

A Python-based photogrammetry pipeline for 3D face reconstructionâ€”perfect as a Computer Vision (CV) showcase in your portfolio.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This endâ€‘toâ€‘end project demonstrates key CV skills:
- **Structureâ€‘fromâ€‘Motion (SfM):** Feature detection, matching, and camera pose estimation using COLMAP.
- **Multiâ€‘View Stereo (MVS):** Dense pointâ€‘cloud generation and mesh reconstruction with OpenMVS.
- **3D Mesh Processing:** Mesh refinement, UV unwrapping, and texture baking.
- **Visualization & Rendering:** Interactive viewing and stylized rendering via `trimesh` & `pyrender`.
- **Automation & Deployment:** Fully automated Python scripts and Docker containerization.
